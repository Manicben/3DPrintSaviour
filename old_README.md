# 3DPrintSaviour

## What is 3DPrintSaviour?
3DPrintSaviour (3DPS) is an automatic print failure detection system for 3D printers and runs on Raspberry Pi 3 Models. It uses Octoprint and Octolapse to get timelapse images, which 3DPS uses to determine if a failure occurred.

## How does it work?
Octolapse generates amazing timelapse images where, from the camera's viewpoint, only the 3D model changes. These images are sent to another Pi (using lsyncd/rsync), where the arrival of a new image (with inotifywait) triggers the Python scripts. By comparing the previous layer image to the current layer image and through the use of OpenCV, a score in the form of a Normalised Root Mean-Squared Error (NRMSE) value is calculated, which represents how similar the two images are, with values over 1 representing a significant deviation. This value stays consistently below 1 after shadow thresholding during a simple 3D print.

This was extended, so that the current image is compared to the image from 5 layers prior. This is named the "deviance" and is calculated in the same way as the score. This value aims to represent how much the print has deviated from past layers. This value is quite high when the current layer has less of a change than the layer from 5 layers prior. An example would be anything with a large base, the base itself is large, anything on top of the base would be smaller in comparison, meaning the deviance would be high. Once 5 layers into the part on top of the base, the deviance will decrease as there is less of a change.
Using both the score and deviance, it is possible to detect when a 3D print has either detached from the bed or a part has broken off, even when the filament has either ran out or clogged.
* Detachment - Score > 1.0 AND Deviance > 1.0
* Breakage - Score Diff > 0.15 AND Deviance Diff > 0.10
* Filament run-out/clog - Score < 0.25 AND Deviance < 0.28

The above threshold values are used to detect when a failure has occurred. If either of the above conditions are true, printcontrol.py sends a pause signal to the printer via the Octoprint REST API and notes down the layer at which the pause was issued and what potentially caused the pause. Please note that 3DPS will not be able to detect a failure within the first 7 layers, but if one has, the system should detect something went wrong later (i.e. the model is missing). 
Please note that the threshold values are subject to change upon further experimentation. They have been chosen purely based on experiment observations.

## Changelog
### 12/06/2018
* Printcontrol tweaked, lowered filament run-out score to 0.23. All affected tests have been redone.
### 11/06/2018
* Printcontrol slightly tweaked. Start checking after layer 7. Breakage dev\_diff lowered to 0.10, Filament run-out deviance lowered to 0.28. All affected tests have been redone.
### 09/06/2018
* Printcontrol slightly changed. Raised Deviance filament threshold from 0.25 to 0.30. Affected tests have been redone.
### 08/06/2018
* Printcontrol slightly changed to only start checking values after layer 6 (had rare occurence when dev\_diff was very high and scr\_diff fluctuated and system triggered)
### 07/06/2018
* Stoppped inotify output (not helpful), added echo to stdout when program starts
* Final adjustments made, testing now in progress
### 06/06/2018
* Breakage detection now works
* Breakage detection uses absolute differences compared to previous layer score/deviance
### 05/06/2018
* Breakage detection no longer working
* Default usage now always produces logfile
* Started work on using previous values from logfile and getting absolute difference between current score/deviance and previous layer values, this should allow for (better) breakage detection
### 04/06/2018 (3DPS V1)
* All work on 3DPS V2 has been indefinitely halted
* Support for filament run-out/clogs added
* Now supports wider range of filament colours, requires better positioning of camera (x-axis must be out of sight)
* Work started on refactoring code and easy installation
### 12/04/2018 (3DPS V1)
* Bugfixes related to previous commit
### 11/04/2018 (3DPS V1)
* Changed run script to use -d (Debug), -l (Logging), -h (Help) flags, as well as the default behaviour when no flags are given. This allows for running whilst logging output, either with (-l) or without (-d) print control, which is useful for data collection after a failure.
### 10/04/2018 (3DPS V1)
* Both SCORE and DEVIANCE values are logged with '-test' or '-t' and printcontrol.py is not run in test mode
* Added new detection based on SCORE and DEVIANCE that detects partial breakages. Needs further testing
* Added DEVIANCE calculation using current image and image from 5 layers prior
* Renamed variables to make more sense
### 08/04/2018 (3DPS V1)
* Renamed run.sh to run. Now uses BASH and can provide '-test' or '-t' to copy output from get\_scores.py to a logfile in the same directory as the images. Useful for gathering NRMSE data for complete prints and view how the values change for each layer
* Forgot to remove old URL and API\_KEY from octoclient\_test.py, has been replaced
* Renamed test scripts and folders (not part of 3DPS, just used to test the setup) 

### 04/04/2018 (3DPS V1)
* Removed (and reset) API keys and URLs. Silly me!
* Refactored Python files to make more sense and be more usable
* Renamed Python files to make more sense and not rely on the score method
* Switched from using Structured Similarity Index (SSIM) to Normalised Root Mean-Squared Error (NRMSE) for the score value
* Changed SSIM threshold to 0.995
* Added background removal by subtracting grayscale image 0 from grayscale images (prev and current) with cv2.absdiff
* Added thresholding to foregound images to remove shadows

### 03/04/2018 (3DPS V1)
* Initial commit to GitHub
* Used SSIM to calculate the score to detect simple print failures (initial SSIM threshold of 0.95)
* Added Readme
* Changed SSIM threshold to 0.973

## Plan and Roadmap
This is a Final Year Project (FYP) at Imperial College London and therefore there are deadlines to meet. Please note that currently I am only testing this system on a modified Original Prusa i3 MK2S and I will not add support for other printers, although doing so should be trivial.

Currently planned are:
* **3DPS V1** Simple failure detection (Is a model there or not) - TESTING
* **3DPS V2** Detection by comparing top-down image with 2D gcode (should be more accurate, but timelapses will not be nice) - NOT STARTED

Other features being considered are:
* Email notification upon print failure with attached snapshot
* Conversion to a Octoprint plugin (will require a lot of work due to the size of OpenCV, but may be possible with an external server processing the images...)
* Attempt to put the entire system on the same Pi hosting Octoprint (probably won't do this, but it may be possible)

His thesis gave me the information needed to improve 3DPS V1, by simply adding the thresholding to remove shadows. Thanks so much, this saved me so much pain and effort and I'm glad I chanced upon your thesis.

Regarding the open-source projects above, I'd also like to thank all of the contributors involved. I understand that such big projects cannot be done on their own and I really appreciate it.
